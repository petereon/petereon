### Hi there 👋

I am a software artisan currently involved with IBM, trying my hand at data engineering and DevOps professionaly. My languages of choice are Python, Clojure, Go and C respectively. I know and dislike Java, JavaScript and PHP.

In my free time:
- 🔭 I’m semi-actively working on `expycted`, an __expect-pattern__ Python testing library
- 🌱 I generate and abandon baby projects at infamous rates
- 📖 I’m learning otherworldy languages like Haskell, OCaml and Elixir
- 🚴 I cycle, jog and lift

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy writing docs
