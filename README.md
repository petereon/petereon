### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer currently involved with IBM, trying my hand at data engineering and DevOps professionaly. Python is my default fallback language but I have been exposed to all of the usual stuff[^1] and I also Lisp.

In my free time:
- ðŸ”­ I am trying to get to grips with category theory and have fun with it
- ðŸŒ± I try to give back to the open source projects I consume
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m producing tiny conceptual projects
- ðŸš´ I cycle, jog and lift

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy writing docs

[^1]: Java, JavaScript, Go, PHP, C
