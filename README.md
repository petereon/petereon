### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software artisan currently involved with IBM, trying my hand at data engineering and DevOps professionaly. My languages of choice are Python, Clojure, Go and C respectively. I know and dislike Java, JavaScript and PHP.

In my free time:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m semi-actively working on `expycted`, an __expect-pattern__ Python testing library
- ðŸŒ± I generate and abandon baby projects at infamous rates
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m producing tiny conceptual projects
- ðŸš´ I cycle, jog and lift

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy writing docs
