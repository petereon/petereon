### Hi there 👋

I am a software developer currently involved with IBM, trying my hand at data engineering and DevOps professionaly. Python is my default fallback language but I have been exposed to all of the usual stuff[^1] and I also Lisp.

In my free time:
- ✨ I’m producing tiny conceptual projects
- 🚴 I cycle, jog and lift

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy writing docs

[^1]: Java, JavaScript, Go, PHP, C
