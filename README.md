*You have to have good reasons \[for a function\] not to be an isomorphism.*  
â€” Bartosz Milewski

I am a software developer currently involved with IBM, trying my hand at data engineering and DevOps professionaly. Python is my default fallback language but I have been exposed to all of the usual stuff[^1] and I also Lisp.

In my free time:
- âœ¨ Iâ€™m producing tiny conceptual projects
- ðŸš´ I cycle, jog and lift
- ðŸ“š I am learning about unreasonaby arcane programming concepts

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy writing docs

[^1]: Java, JavaScript, Go, PHP, C
